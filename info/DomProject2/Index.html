            <div class="answer">
                To really meet your customers where they are, harness your CRM data to discover the most common questions across all channels and see how support reps categorize them. 
                Ask your reps to keep logs of unusually helpful solutions they’ve shared with customers while they’re on support calls, too. If the questions to these answers are straightforward enough, add them to the FAQ page.             
                Another way to figure out what questions to answer is to have non-native users pilot your site and products. Then, ask them if they found any aspects confusing. This gives you the “outsider” perspective you may not be able to find with your deeper knowledge of your brand.

            <div class="answer">
                Once you've pinpointed the most frequently asked questions, you'll need to decide who is going to respond to them—and how they'll go about doing it.

            <div class="question">Offer multiple solutions</div>
            <div class="answer">
                Think beyond a sentence or two as a response, and consider how you can add extra value to your customers' experience. Link to other tutorials, articles, or web pages in your answer so customers can easily find related resources.

            <div class="answer">
                Don't stop thinking about your FAQ page once you have a handful of questions and answers posted. Instead, look for ways to constantly add to your answer bank, and continue to shift the questions you post based on customer needs.

            <div class="question">What is the purpose of an FAQ page?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                The purpose of an FAQ page is to provide quick answers to common questions that your business can anticipate. An FAQ page empowers customers to self-serve, enabling them to find solutions quickly on their own. FAQ pages aren't meant to solve every issue, which is why it's important to include an option for customers to contact a live agent.
